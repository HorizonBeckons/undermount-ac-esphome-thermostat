# Undermount AC V2 Hardware Adaptation

This repository contains an adapted version of the Undermount AC ESPHome Thermostat, specifically optimized for **Undermount AC V2 hardware systems**. The original V3 codebase had compatibility issues with V2 hardware, particularly preventing the fan from fully shutting off when the system was in OFF mode.

## Problem Statement

The primary issue addressed was documented in **GitHub Issue #18**, where the V3 code would not allow V2 systems to properly disable the fan. When the thermostat was set to OFF mode, the fan would continue operating at a low speed instead of shutting down completely.

## Hardware Differences: V2 vs V3

### V2 Connector Matrix (This Implementation)
- **Output 1** - Blower Speed (Red Wire)
- **Output 2** - Blower Power On/Off (Yellow Wire)
- **Output 3** - Compressor Power (Blue Wire)
- **Output 4** - High-Speed Compressor (Orange Wire)
- **Output 5** - Unused
- **Output 6** - Unused
- **POS** - DC+ IN (Red/White Wire)
- **NEG** - DC- IN (Black Wire)

### V3 Connector Matrix (Original)
- **Output 1** - Blower Speed (White Wire)
- **Output 2** - Blower Power On/Off (Brown Wire)
- **Output 3** - Compressor Power (Blue Wire)
- **Output 4** - High-Speed Compressor (Green Wire)
- **Output 5** - Unused
- **Output 6** - Unused

## Key Changes and Enhancements

### üîß True Fan OFF Capability
- **Problem**: V3 code maintained minimum 15% blower speed even in OFF mode
- **Solution**: Modified `blower_pwm_filter` to support true 0% operation
- **Implementation**: 
  ```yaml
  min_power: 0.00  # Changed from 0.15 to allow true off capability
  ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Compressor Protection System
- Added comprehensive short-cycle protection with safety timers
- Implemented pending request handling for delayed shutdowns
- Added emergency safety checks to prevent compressor operation without blower

### üéØ Improved PID Control
- Increased proportional gain from 0.2 to 0.5 for better responsiveness
- Enhanced PID logic with mode-specific minimum handling
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### üîí Safety Enhancements
- **Evaporator Protection**: Enforced minimum 40% blower speed during cooling
- **High-Speed Protection**: Automatic 70% minimum when high-speed compressor active
- **Emergency Monitoring**: System monitor to detect unsafe conditions

### üå™Ô∏è Fan Control Improvements
- **Fan-Only Mode**: Removed artificial minimums for natural PID control
- **Ramping Logic**: Enhanced to support true 0% shutdown
- **Mode Transitions**: Improved handling between cooling, idle, and off modes

## Critical Code Changes

### Blower PWM Filter Enhancement
```yaml
write_action:
  - lambda: |-
      // Handle true zero case
      if (state <= 0.0) {
        id(blower_pwm).set_level(0.0);
        id(blower_speed_called).publish_state(0.0);
        ESP_LOGD("Blower PWM Filter", "Blower OFF - State: %.2f, Duty: 0.00", state);
        return;
      }
```

### Compressor Protection Logic
```yaml
- lambda: |-
    // Check if short cycle protection should prevent this
    uint32_t time_since_start = millis() - id(compressor_start_time);
    bool protection_active = (time_since_start < 120000 && id(compressor_short_cycle_protection));
    
    if (protection_active) {
      ESP_LOGW("Protection", "Compressor turn-off blocked by short cycle protection");
      return; // Block the shutdown without forcing back on
    }
```

### Enhanced OFF Mode Handling
```yaml
off_mode:
  - switch.turn_off: compressor_power
  - switch.turn_off: compressor_speed_high
  - if:
      condition:
        lambda: return !id(compressor_power).state;
      then:
        # Normal shutdown sequence with evaporator purge
      else:
        # Maintain cooling airflow if compressor protection active
```

## New Diagnostic Features

### Protection Monitoring
- **Compressor Protection Time Remaining** - Shows active protection countdown
- **Compressor Short Cycle Protection Active** - Binary status indicator
- **PID Target Speed / PID Current Speed** - Real-time PID monitoring

### Safety Buttons
- **Trigger PID Test** - Manual PID execution for troubleshooting
- **Reset Cooling Minimum to Safe Default** - Emergency safety reset

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Undermount AC V2 hardware system
- ESPHome environment
- Home Assistant (recommended)

### Configuration Steps
1. Use the provided `undermount-ac.yaml` configuration
2. Update WiFi credentials in the file
3. Flash to ESPHome Thermostat Controller 12-31V DC device
4. Connect to Undermount AC V2 hardware using the V2 connector matrix
5. Monitor diagnostic entities in Home Assistant for proper operation

## Safety Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never operate compressor without blower** - System includes automatic protection  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Minimum cooling speeds enforced** - 40% minimum during cooling to prevent evaporator freeze  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Short-cycle protection** - 2-minute minimum run/off times for compressor longevity  

## Testing and Validation

This adaptation has been thoroughly tested on V2 hardware with the following validation:

- ‚úÖ Complete fan shutdown in OFF mode
- ‚úÖ Proper compressor protection timing
- ‚úÖ Evaporator freeze prevention
- ‚úÖ Smooth PID control operation
- ‚úÖ Emergency safety system activation

## Troubleshooting

### Fan Won't Turn Off
- Check diagnostic sensor **Output 2 (Blower Power)**
- Verify `min_power: 0.00` in `blower_pwm_filter` configuration
- Monitor **Ramp Blower** status for active ramping

### Compressor Issues
- Monitor **Compressor Protection Time Remaining**
- Check **Compressor Short Cycle Protection Active** status
- Review ESPHome logs for protection messages

### PID Performance
- Use **Trigger PID Test** button for manual testing
- Monitor **PID Target Speed** vs **PID Current Speed** sensors
- Adjust Kp value if response is too slow/fast
